    <prayer>
        <title>Psalm 3</title>
        <content>LORD, how they have increased who trouble me! Many are they who rise up against me. Many are they who say of me, “There is no help for him in God.” But You, O LORD, are a shield for me, My glory and the One who lifts up my head. I cried to the LORD with my voice, And He heard me from His holy hill. . I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustained me. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me all around. Arise, O LORD; Save me, O my God! For You have struck all my enemies on the cheekbone; You have broken the teeth of the ungodly. Salvation belongs to the LORD. Your blessing is upon Your people. Alleluia.

    <prayer>
        <title>Psalm 6</title>
        <content>O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger, Nor chasten me in Your hot displeasure. Have mercy on me, O LORD, for I am weak; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are troubled. My soul also is greatly troubled; But You, O LORD—how long? Return, O LORD, deliver me! Oh, save me for Your mercies’ sake! For in death there is no remembrance of You; In the grave who will give You thanks? I am weary with my groaning; All night I make my bed swim; I drench my couch with my tears. My eye wastes away because of grief; It grows old because of all my enemies. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; For the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping. The LORD has heard my supplication; The LORD will receive my prayer. Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled; Let them turn back and be ashamed suddenly. Alleluia.

    <prayer>
        <title>Psalm 13</title>
        <content>How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me? How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart daily? How long will my enemy be exalted over me? Consider and hear me, O LORD my God; Enlighten my eyes, Lest I sleep the sleep of death; Lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him”; Lest those who trouble me rejoice when I am moved. But I have trusted in Your mercy; My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation. I will sing to the LORD, Because He has dealt bountifully with me. Alleluia.

    <prayer>
        <title>Psalm 70</title>
        <content>Make haste, O God, to deliver me! Make haste to help me, O LORD! Let them be ashamed and confounded Who seek my life; Let them be turned back and confused Who desire my hurt. Let them be turned back because of their shame, Who say, “Aha, aha!” Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; And let those who love Your salvation say continually, “Let God be magnified!” But I am poor and needy; Make haste to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay. Alleluia.

    <prayer>
        <title>Psalm 86</title>
        <content>Bow down Your ear, O LORD, hear me; For I am poor and needy. Preserve my life, for I am holy; You are my God; Save Your servant who trusts in You! Be merciful to me, O Lord, For I cry to You all day long. Rejoice the soul of Your servant, For to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul. For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, And abundant in mercy to all those who call upon You. Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; And attend to the voice of my supplications. In the day of my trouble I will call upon You, For You will answer me. Among the gods there is none like You, O Lord; Nor are there any works like Your works. All nations whom You have made Shall come and worship before You, O Lord, And shall glorify Your name. For You are great, and do wondrous things; You alone are God. Teach me Your way, O LORD; I will walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your name. I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart, And I will glorify Your name forevermore. For great is Your mercy toward me, And You have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol. O God, the proud have risen against me, And a mob of violent men have sought my life, And have not set You before them. But You, O Lord, are a God full of compassion, and gracious, Long-suffering and abundant in mercy and truth. Oh, turn to me, and have mercy on me! Give Your strength to Your servant, And save the son of Your maidservant. Show me a sign for good, That those who hate me may see it and be ashamed, Because You, LORD, have helped me and comforted me. Alleluia.

    <prayer>
        <title>Psalm 91</title>
        <content>He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, “He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust.” Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler And from the perilous pestilence. He shall cover you with His feathers, And under His wings you shall take refuge; His truth shall be your shield and buckler. You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, Nor of the arrow that flies by day, Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday. A thousand may fall at your side, And ten thousand at your right hand; But it shall not come near you. Only with your eyes shall you look, And see the reward of the wicked. Because you have made the LORD, who is my refuge, Even the Most High, your habitation, No evil shall befall you, Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling; For He shall give His angels charge over you, To keep you in all your ways. They shall bear you up in their hands, Lest you dash your foot against a stone. You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra, The young lion and the serpent you shall trample under foot. Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him on high, because he has known My name. He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honour him. With long life I will satisfy him, And show him My salvation. Alleluia.

        <title>Psalm 117</title>
        <content>Oh, praise the LORD, all you Gentiles! Laud Him, all you peoples! For His merciful kindness is great toward us, And the truth of the LORD endures forever. Praise the LORD! Alleluia.

    </prayer>
    
    <prayer>
        <title>Psalm 118</title>
        <content>Oh, give thanks to the LORD, for He is good! Because His mercy endures forever. Let Israel now say, “His mercy endures forever.” Let the house of Aaron now say, “His mercy endures forever.” Let those who fear the LORD now say, “His mercy endures forever.” I called on the LORD in distress; The LORD answered me and set me in a broad place. The LORD is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me? The LORD is for me among those who help me; Therefore I shall see my desire on those who hate me. It is better to trust in the LORD Than to put confidence in man. It is better to trust in the LORD Than to put confidence in princes. All nations surrounded me, But in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. They surrounded me, Yes, they surrounded me; But in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. They surrounded me like bees; They were quenched like a fire of thorns; For in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. You pushed me violently, that I might fall, But the LORD helped me. The LORD is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation. The voice of rejoicing and salvation Is in the tents of the righteous; The right hand of the LORD does valiantly. The right hand of the LORD is exalted; The right hand of the LORD does valiantly. I shall not die, but live, And declare the works of the LORD. The LORD has chastened me severely, But He has not given me over to death. Open to me the gates of righteousness; I will go through them, And I will praise the LORD. This is the gate of the LORD, Through which the righteous shall enter. I will praise You, For You have answered me, And have become my salvation. The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone. This was the Lord’s doing; It is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which the LORD has made; We will rejoice and be glad in it. Save now, I pray, O LORD; O LORD, I pray, send now prosperity. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD! We have blessed you from the house of the LORD. God is the LORD, And He has given us light; Bind the sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar. You are my God, and I will praise You; You are my God, I will exalt You. Oh, give thanks to the LORD, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever. Alleluia.

Your commandments! Your word I have hidden in

Remove from me reproach and contempt, For I have kept Your testimonies. Princes also sit and speak
against me, But Your servant meditates on Your

my counsellors. Glory be to You O lover of mankind.

Indignation has taken hold of me Because of the wicked, who forsake Your law. Your statutes have

meet the bridegroom. “Now five of them were wise,
and five were foolish. “Those who were foolish took
their lamps and took no oil with them, “but the wise
took oil in their vessels with their lamps. “But while
the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered and
slept. “And at midnight a cry was heard: ‘Behold, the
bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!’ “Then all
those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. “And
the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil,
for our lamps are going out.’ “But the wise answered,
saying, ‘No, lest there should not be enough for us
and you; but go rather to those who sell, and buy for
yourselves.’ “And while they went to buy, the bridegroom
came, and those who were ready went in with
him to the wedding; and the door was shut. “Afterward
the other virgins came also, saying, ‘Lord,
Lord, open to us!’ “But he answered and said, ‘Assuredly,
I say to you, I do not know you.’ “Watch
therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.
Glory be to God forever. Amen.

        <content>Behold, the bridegroom comes at midnight.
Blessed is the servant whom He finds awake, But he
who is found in slumber does not deserve to go with
Him. Keep your watch my soul, Lest You go to sleep
and be thrown outside the Kingdom. Keep awake
and shout: Holy, Holy, Holy are You God, for the
sake of the Mother of God, have mercy upon us.

Remember my soul that awesome day, awake
and light your lamp with the oil of joy for you do not
know when the voice will call: “Behold, here comes
the bridegroom”. Watch, my soul, that you do not fall
asleep lest you should stay outside knocking like the
five foolish virgins. But watch with prayers in order
to meet the Lord, Christ, with rich oil. He will bestow
upon you the joys of His true divine glory. Ke-neen

O’ Virgin Mother of God, You are the bastion of
our salvation, our impregnable fortress, suppress the
conspiracies of the enemy, transform our sorrows
into joy, fortify our city, protect those who govern us,
plead for the peace of the world, for You are our
hope, O’ Mother of God. Ke-neen Ke-a-ee Ke-istouse E-onas ton E-onon. Amen.
O’ Heavenly King, the Spirit of truth, the comforter,
who is every where and fills everybody. You
are the treasure of goodness and giver of life, we ask
You to graciously come and dwell with in us, purify
us from iniquity and save our souls. Thok-sa-patri

Lord, abide with us as You did with the apostles,
when You gave them Your peace, we ask You to
grant us Your peace, our Saviour; save us and spare
our souls. Ke-neen Ke-a-ee Ke-is-touse E-onas ton

For thrones are set there for judgment, The thrones of the house of David. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May they prosper who love you.

        <content>A chapter from the Holy Gospel according to St. Luke may his blessings be with us all. Amen. Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went to the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to eat. And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil, and stood at His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil. Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, “This man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner.” And Jesus answered and said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” And he said, “Teacher, say it.” “There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. “And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?” Simon answered and said, “I suppose the one whom he forgave more.” And He said to him, “You	have rightly judged.” Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head. “You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in. “You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil. “Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are	many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.” And He said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” And those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” Then He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.’ Glory be to God forever. Amen.

Let us go into His tabernacle; Let us worship at His footstool. Arise, O LORD, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength. Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, And let Your saints shout for joy. For Your servant David’s sake, Do not turn away the face of Your Anointed. The LORD has sworn in truth to David; He will not turn from it: “I will set upon your throne the fruit of your body. If your sons will keep My covenant And My testimony which I shall teach them, Their sons also shall sit upon your throne forevermore.” For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation: “This is My resting place forever; Here I will dwell, for I have desired it. I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread. I will also clothe her priests with salvation, And her saints shall shout aloud for joy. There I will make the horn of David grow; I will prepare a lamp for My Anointed. His enemies I will clothe with shame, But upon Himself His crown shall flourish.” Alleluia.

If I forget you, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget her skill! If I do not remember you, Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth—If I do not exalt Jerusalem Above my chief joy. Remember, O LORD, against the sons of Edom The day of Jerusalem, Who said, “Raze it, raze it, To its very foundation!” O daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed, Happy shall he be who repays you as you have served us!

Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; Keep watch over the door of my lips. Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, To practice wicked works With men who work iniquity; And do not let me eat of their delicacies. Let the righteous strike me; It shall be a kindness. And let him reprove me; It shall be as excellent oil; Let my head not refuse it. For still my prayer is against the deeds of the wicked. Their judges are overthrown by the sides of the cliff, And they hear my words, for they are sweet. Our bones are scattered at the mouth of the grave, As when one ploughs and breaks up the earth. But my eyes are upon You, O God the Lord; In You I take refuge; Do not leave my soul destitute. Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, And from the traps of the workers of iniquity. Let the wicked fall into their own nets, While I escape safely. Alleluia.

When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Then You knew my path. In the way in which I walk They have secretly set a snare for me. Look on my right hand and see, For there is no one who acknowledges me; Refuge has failed me; No one cares for my soul. I cried out to You, O LORD: I said, “You are my refuge, My portion in the land of the living. Attend to my cry, For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are stronger than I. Bring my soul out of prison, That I may praise Your name; The righteous shall surround me, For You shall deal bountifully with me.” Alleluia.

Do not put your trust in princes, Nor in a son of man, in whom there is no help. His spirit departs, he returns to his earth; In that very day his plans perish. Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, Whose hope is in the LORD his God, Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that is in them; Who keeps truth forever, Who executes justice for the oppressed, Who gives food to the hungry. The LORD gives freedom to the prisoners. The LORD opens the eyes of the blind; The LORD raises those who are bowed down; The LORD loves the righteous. The LORD watches over the strangers; He relieves the fatherless and widow; But the way of the wicked He turns upside down. The LORD shall reign forever—Your God, O Zion, to all generations. Alleluia.

The LORD lifts up the humble; He casts the wicked down to the ground. Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; Sing praises on the harp to our God, Who covers the heavens with clouds, Who prepares rain for the earth, Who makes grass to grow on the mountains. He gives to the beast its food, And to the young ravens that cry. He does not delight in the strength of the horse; He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.

He gives snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes; He casts out His hail like morsels; Who can stand before His cold? He sends out His word and melts them; He causes His wind to blow, and the waters flow. He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel. He has not dealt thus with any nation; And as for His judgments, they have not known them. Alleluia.

according to St. Luke
may his blessings be with us all. Amen.
“Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father’s
good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” Sell what
you have and give alms; provide yourselves money
bags which do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens
that does not fail, where no thief approaches nor
moth destroys. “For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. “Let your waist be girded and
your lamps burning; “and you yourselves be like
men who wait for their master, when he will return
from the wedding, that when he comes and knocks
they may open to him immediately. “Blessed are
those servants whom the master, when he comes,
will find watching. Assuredly, I say to you that he
will gird himself and have them sit down to eat, and
will come and serve them. “And if he should come in
the second watch, or come in the third watch, and
find them so, blessed are those servants. “But know
this, that if the master of the house had known what
hour the thief would come, he would have watched
and not allowed his house to be broken into. “Therefore
you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming
at an hour you do not expect.” Then Peter said to
Him, “Lord, do You speak this parable only to us, or
to all people?” And the Lord said, “Who then is that
faithful and wise steward, whom his master will
make ruler over his household, to give them their
portion of food in due season? “Blessed is that servant
whom his master will find so doing when he
comes. “Truly, I say to you that he will make him
ruler over all that he has. “But if that servant says in
his heart, ‘My master is delaying his coming,’ and
begins to beat the menservants and maidservants,
and to eat and drink and be drunk, “the master of that
servant will come on a day when he is not looking for him, and at an hour when he is not aware; and will cut
him in two and appoint him his portion with the
unbelievers.

mercy on others. O’ Saviour, help me, for You alone
have such love for humanity. Ke-neen Ke-a-ee Keis-
touse E-onas ton E-onon. Amen.
O’ Graceful Mother of God, help those who come
to your faith. As we glorify Your immaculate birth of
Our Saviour. Ke-neen Ke-a-ee Ke-is-touse E-onas
ton E-onon. Amen.
O’ Heavenly King, the Spirit of truth, the comforter,
who is every where and fills everybody. You
are the treasure of goodness and giver of life, we ask
You to graciously come and dwell with in us, purify us from iniquity and save our souls. Thok-sa-patri
Ke ey-you Ke agiyou ep-nevmaty.
Lord, abide with us as You did with the apostles,
when You gave them Your peace, we ask You to
grant us Your peace, our Saviour; save us and spare
our souls. Ke-neen Ke-a-ee Ke-is-touse E-onas ton
E-onon. Amen.
Whenever we stand in Your Holy Temple, we are
considered as those who abide in heaven. O’ Mother
of God, you are the gate of heaven, open to us the
door of mercy.
Lord have mercy (Kir-ye ley-son) 41 times.

        <title>The Creed</title>
        <content>Truly we believe in One God, the Almighty God the Father, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages; light out of light, true God out of true God, begotten not made; consubstantial with the Father, through whom all things came into being. He descended from heaven for us and for our salvation, and was incarnated from the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary, and became man. He was crucified for us at the time of Pontius Pilate. He suffered and was buried; arose from the dead on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures; He ascended to the heavens and sat at the right hand of the Father; He shall also come in His glory to judge the living and the dead; of whose kingdom there will be no end. Truly we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lifegiving Lord, who proceeds from the Father, we worship and glorify Him together with the Father and the Son, who spoke in the prophets. And in one, holy, universal and Apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins. And we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen. Lord have mercy (Kir-ye ley-son) 41 times.

        <title>The Absolution</title>
        <content>Lord Jesus Christ, Son of our eternal God, enlighten
our minds to understand Your life giving
words. Raise us from the darkness of mortal sin,
make us worthy to be steady in virtue. When You
come to judge the world, grant us to hear the joyful
call; “Come you that are blessed by My Father! Come
and inherit the Kingdom that has been prepared for
you since the creation of the world!”
Lord grant us to attend at that hour without fear,
anxiety or condemnation. Do not judge us according
to our sins, because You alone, have such compassion,
patience and mercy. May You accept these
prayers through the pleadings of the Holy Mother of
God, Virgin Mary and all the saints. Amen.

		<title>The Concluding Prayer</title>
		<content>Have mercy upon us O’ God, have mercy upon us. For You are always worshipped and glorified in heaven and on earth. O’ Christ, our good Lord, plenteous in patience, mercy and compassion, who loves the just and shows mercy to all sinners amongst whom I am the first. Who does not wish death for the sinner but repentance and life, calling us all to salvation for the promised forthcoming rewards. O’ Lord, accept our prayers of this hour and every hour. Ease our lives, and guide us to act according to Your commandments. Sanctify our souls, purify our bodies, set right our thoughts, cleanse our intentions, heal our sickness, forgive us our sins and deliver us from every evil grief and distress. Surround us with Your Holy angels that we may be guided and guarded with them to attain the unity of faith and knowledge of Your imperceptible and infinite glory, for You are blessed for ever. Amen. </content>
